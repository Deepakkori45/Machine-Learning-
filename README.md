# Machine-Learning

# 1) K-means Clustering (Kmean.ipynb):

Implement K-Means clustering on socio-economic and health data of countries.
Explore optimal cluster numbers, visualize results, and interpret cluster characteristics.
Analyze how K-Means clusters contribute to determining the overall country development.
Provide insights into significant factors driving the clustering outcomes.

# 2) K-medoids Clustering (kmedoid.ipynb):

Apply K-Medoid clustering to the same socio-economic and health dataset.
Compare clustering results with K-Means, highlighting differences and similarities.
Discuss the implications of K-Medoid clusters for assessing country development.
Identify and interpret key socio-economic and health factors shaping K-Medoid clusters.

# 3) Linear Regression (Linear_Regression.ipynb):

Use a suitable dataset to implement linear regression.
Explore the relationship between variables and interpret the regression coefficients.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

# 4) Density-Based Clustering (DBscan.ipynb):

Implement the DBSCAN algorithm on a dataset with varying densities.
Visualize the clusters and identify outliers.
Discuss situations where DBSCAN is advantageous over other clustering methods.

**Limitation of Silhouette score:**
