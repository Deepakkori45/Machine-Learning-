Tasks:

1) K-means Clustering (Kmean.ipynb):

Implement the K-means clustering algorithm on a dataset of your choice.
Visualize the clustered data and analyze the results.
Experiment with different values of K and observe the impact on clustering.

2) K-medoids Clustering (kmedoid.ipynb):

Implement the K-medoids clustering algorithm on a dataset.
Compare and contrast the results with those obtained from K-means clustering.
Discuss scenarios where K-medoids might be preferable.

3) Linear Regression (Linear_Regression.ipynb):

Use a suitable dataset to implement linear regression.
Explore the relationship between variables and interpret the regression coefficients.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

4) Density-Based Clustering (DBscan.ipynb):

Implement the DBSCAN algorithm on a dataset with varying densities.
Visualize the clusters and identify outliers.
Discuss situations where DBSCAN is advantageous over other clustering methods.
